<p>TURKEY RAISING is usually carried on as a side
line on general farms, though in some parts
of the United States it constitutes the chief source of
revenue from farming.</p>

<p>The number of turkeys in this country decreased
for a time after the 1890 census, but during recent
years the industry has been growing, largely because
of improved methods of controlling turkey diseases
and better methods of management.</p>

<p>This bulletin has been prepared primarily to inform
those interested in turkey raising on modern methods
of management. Most of the recommendations are
adaptable to both small and large scale production.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_TURKEY_INDUSTRY_OF_THE_UNITED_STATES" id="THE_TURKEY_INDUSTRY_OF_THE_UNITED_STATES">THE TURKEY INDUSTRY OF THE UNITED STATES</a></h2>


<p>TURKEY RAISING has long been an important enterprise in
the United States because great quantities of turkey meat are required
annually and its use throughout the year is becoming more
popular. Producers should endeavor to make turkey raising more
profitable by overcoming heavy losses from diseases that heretofore
have been a serious handicap.</p>

<p>The enterprise is very adaptable, extending to practically all parts
of the United States. The more important areas of production are
the Middle Western, Northwestern, and Southwestern States, where
large numbers of small flocks are raised annually on farms and ranches
and where there are also many large commercial flocks. The number
of turkeys in this country began to decrease about 1890, but by
1910 interest in turkey raising revived, and in recent years the industry
has been growing, largely because of increased knowledge of
blackhead disease and its control.</p>

<p>According to the census there were 3,688,000 turkeys on farms in
the United States in 1910 and about the same number in 1920. The
1930 census showed 16,794,000 turkeys, but this was the number
raised to market age instead of the number of breeding turkeys kept.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">« 2 »</a></span>
This new census figure provides a much better measure of the industry's
actual size. The 1930 figure indicates a moderate increase
between 1920 and 1930 in the number of breeding turkeys kept. The
nine States leading in turkey production, as shown by the 1930 census,
are Texas, North Dakota, Minnesota, California, Oklahoma, Oregon,
Colorado, Virginia, and Idaho.</p>

<p>Where conditions are suitable and proper methods of management
are followed turkeys can be raised successfully with very simple
equipment; therefore the capital outlay in the enterprise may be quite
small. Except during the growing season managing the flock is
fairly simple. Of course, constitutional vigor must be maintained in
the breeding stock; the flock must be kept relatively free from disease;
and the soil, especially where the poults are fed, must be kept
sanitary. Moreover,
turkeys, even when
veil fed, will make
good use of at least
a limited range and in
doing so will destroy
many injurious insects, eat great quantities of succulent
green feed, and pick
up much waste grain,
weed seeds, and other
sources of nutriment.
This fact reduces the
cost of production and
increases the profits.</p>

</div>

<p>All domestic varieties
of turkeys have
descended from the
North American wild
stock, comprising the
eastern wild turkey,
which ranged over the
eastern part of the
United States from
Maine to Florida; the Florida wild turkey, which ranged over southern
Florida; the Rio Grande wild turkey, which ranged over southern
Texas and northwestern Mexico; and the Mexican wild turkey, which
ranged over Arizona, western New Mexico, southern Colorado, and
Mexico. It is probable, however, that these four wild turkeys were
of common origin and that most of our domesticated varieties,
especially the Bronze, have descended from the Mexican wild turkey.</p>

<p>Six standard varieties of domestic turkeys are recognized by the
American Poultry Association, an organization having as its primary
function the promotion of standard qualities in all breeds and varieties
of poultry in North America. The association publishes the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">« 3 »</a></span>
Standard of Perfection, which contains concise descriptions of breeds
and varieties of poultry, with illustrations of the most important
ones.</p>

<p>The following is a brief description of each of the six varieties,
namely, the Bronze, White Holland, Bourbon Red, Narragansett,
Black, and Slate.</p>



<div class="fig_center" style="width: 343px;"><a id="Figure_2"></a>
<img src="images/fig2.png" width="343" height="280" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 2.</span>&mdash;Bronze turkey, female.</div>
</div>



<h3><a id="THE_BRONZE"></a>THE BRONZE</h3>

<p>The Bronze, often called the Mammoth Bronze, is the heaviest and
also the most popular variety. The male (<a href="#Figure_1">fig. 1</a>) is distinguished
by (1) the rich, iridescent, red-green sheen of the plumage on the
neck, wing bows, wing fronts, wing coverts, breast, front half of the
back, and lower thighs; and (2) the lighter, brilliant, copper-colored
bronzing of the rear half of the back, tail coverts, tail itself, and
body. The bronzing in the tail, tail coverts, and body is bordered
by a distinct narrow black band, which in turn is bordered by a wide
edging of pure white. The rear portion of the back has the broad
bronze bar with the narrow edging of black but does not have the
white tips. The plumage of the female (<a href="#Figure_2">fig. 2</a>) is similar to that of
the male, except for an edging of white on the black bars on the
back, wing bows, wing coverts, breast, and body. This white edging
is narrow in the front of the body and gradually widens toward the
rear. Both sexes have the same color pattern in the large wing
feathers and in the main tail feathers and coverts. The main tail
feathers and coverts have brown penciling (narrow bars) on a dull
black background; the large wing feathers are evenly barred with
black and white, the bars of the secondaries becoming indistinct as
the back is approached. Creaminess, yellow, or yellowish brown in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">« 4 »</a></span>
the pure white edging of the main tail feathers and coverts of the
Bronze indicates an admixture of wild-turkey blood and is a serious
defect in the standardbred Bronze. Lack of the copper-colored
bronzing or a tendency for it to be greenish is also a serious color
defect.</p>


<h3><a id="THE_WHITE_HOLLAND"></a>THE WHITE HOLLAND</h3>

<p>The White Holland (<a href="#Figure_3">fig. 3</a>) probably originated as a "sport"
from the Bronze or the wild turkey. Its plumage should be pure
white in color and free in all sections from black flecking or ticking.
The shanks and toes in this variety should be pinkish white.</p>


<h3><a id="THE_BOURBON_RED"></a>THE BOURBON RED</h3>

<p>The Bourbon Red male (<a href="#Figure_4">fig. 4</a>) is of a rich, deep brownish-red
color in all sections except the wings, tail, and breast. The primaries
and secondaries of
the wings are pure white,
and the main tail feathers
are pure white except for
an indistinct bar of red
crossing each feather near
the end. The breast
feathers are red with a
very narrow edging of
black. The color of the
female is similar to that
of the male, but there is a
very narrow edging of
white on the tips of the
breast feathers. More
than one-third of any
other color except white
showing in the large
feathers of the wing or
tail constitutes a standard
disqualification in this
variety. The rich reddish
color, without some black,
is rather difficult to obtain
and this black ticking or
flecking is a rather common
fault. A faded red,
approaching buff, is also undesirable.</p>

<img src="images/fig3.png" width="261" height="346" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 3.</span>&mdash;White Holland turkey, male.</div>
</div>


<h3><a id="THE_NARRAGANSETT"></a>THE NARRAGANSETT</h3>

<p>The Narragansett (<a href="#Figure_5">fig. 5</a>) generally resembles the Bronze in color
pattern, but has no iridescent red-green sheen and no bronzing. The
Narragansett colors are metallic black with light steel-gray edging
and barring bordered, in certain sections, by a narrow black band on
the end of the feathers. The plumage, as a whole, has a dark background
of metallic black with a broad, light steel-gray edging, showing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">« 5 »</a></span>
more of the light color in this edging as the body is approached.
In the male, the colors of the wing fronts, wing bows, and wing
coverts are the reverse of the colors found elsewhere, being light
steel gray, ending in a narrow band of black. The wing coverts form
a broad silvery bar across the folded wings. The neck and saddle
are black, ending in a broad steel-gray band. The back is rich
metallic black, free from bronzing. The breast, body, and fluff are
black, the feathers ending in a broad silvery-gray band edged with
black. The large wing and tail feathers and the primary coverts
are barred with black and white similarly to those of the Bronze,
the barring of the upper secondaries becoming indistinct as the back
is approached.</p>

<p>The plumage of the female is similar to that of the male in this
variety, except that an extra edging of silvery gray is added to the
ends of the feathers on the back, wing bows, wing coverts, breast,
and body. The light edging should be narrow toward the front
of the bird and broader toward the rear. The female in general
presents a lighter appearance than the male. There should be a rich
metallic black but no bronze barring in either sex. The offspring
of a Narragansett mating sometimes have a bronze color, but such
birds should not be kept for breeders.</p>

</div>


<h3><a id="THE_BLACK"></a>THE BLACK</h3>

<p>The Black (<a href="#Figure_6">fig. 6</a>), known in England as the Norfolk turkey,
is lustrous greenish black in all sections of the plumage. Objectionable
white tipping in the feathers of young turkeys of this variety
often disappears after the first molt. Any variation from the
solid black color should be carefully avoided in breeding this variety.
The shanks and toes should be pink in mature birds and almost black
in young birds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">« 6 »</a></span></p>


<h3><a id="THE_SLATE"></a>THE SLATE</h3>

<p>The Slate (<a href="#Figure_7">fig. 7</a>) has an ashy-blue or slate-colored plumage, sometimes
dotted with tiny black spots, which are undesirable. Feathers
of any other color, such as white, buff, or red, constitute a standard
disqualification. This variety does not breed true to color, and many
of the offspring have both solid white and solid black as well as
black-and-white ticking and splashing. The shanks and toes should
be pink.</p>

<h2><a name="SELECTING_BREEDING_STOCK" id="SELECTING_BREEDING_STOCK">SELECTING BREEDING STOCK</a></h2>


<p>The breeding stock is the foundation of the turkey industry, and
the greatest care must be used in selecting both male and female
breeders. Failure in this respect has undoubtedly been one of the
principal reasons why satisfactory results have not been obtained
on many farms and commercial plants. One of the first steps in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">« 7 »</a></span>
improving conditions, therefore, is more careful selection of the
breeding stock.</p>

<p>The most satisfactory time of the year to select breeding stock is
in November or December, especially before large numbers of turkeys
are sold for the Thanksgiving and Christmas markets. Selecting
birds early in the season makes possible a choice from a larger number
and, what is more important, saves the best-developed and most
vigorous birds for breeding instead of marketing them. New blood
may be introduced into the flock or a beginning with turkeys may
be made by obtaining hatching eggs, day-old poults, or breeding
stock, but the purchase of eggs or poults is recommended. New
breeding stock should be treated for worms and lice and should be
quarantined for 2 or 3 weeks to detect any disease.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 315px;"><a id="Figure_6"></a>
<img src="images/fig6.png" width="315" height="313" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 6.</span>&mdash;Black turkey, male.</div>
</div>

<p>Turkeys are raised for meat rather than for egg production. The
breeders, therefore, should have compact, meaty bodies. The breastbone
should be straight, the back broad, especially at the shoulders,
and the breadth carried well back toward the tail. The body should
be deep, with the breast so broad, full, and well rounded that the
breastbone does not protrude prominently. Other important points
are full, bright eyes, a broad head, and stout legs set well apart and
rather short. Above all else, the birds should be vigorous. When,
pedigrees and performance records of the birds' ancestors are available,
selection should be based on fertility, hatchability, livability,
early maturity, and other desirable factors, as well as on the physical
points mentioned above.</p>

<p>It is wise to select or build up a flock of purebred turkeys. It
costs no more to raise purebred stock than mongrels and the purebreds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">« 8 »</a></span>
are usually heavier and command higher market prices. Also,
if good standard qualities of shape and color are maintained, some
of the birds can be sold for breeding purposes at increased prices.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="MANAGING_BREEDING_STOCK" id="MANAGING_BREEDING_STOCK">MANAGING BREEDING STOCK</a></h2>


<p>Results in turkey raising depend to a large extent on the kind
of breeding stock used each year and the manner in which it is
managed.</p>


<h3><a id="BREEDING_PENS"></a>BREEDING PENS OR ENCLOSURES</h3>

<p>Until a few years ago breeding flocks were ordinarily allowed free
range throughout the breeding and laying season (<a href="#Figure_8">fig. 8</a>). This
practice often gives unsatisfactory results because the nests cannot
be found readily and therefore the eggs cannot be gathered daily.
Many breeding flocks
are now kept in good-sized
breeding pens
or enclosures with
nests conveniently
located inside or outside
the roosting shed
(<a href="#Figure_9">fig. 9</a>). For a pen
of 12 to 18 birds a
yard of 10 to 15
square rods is large
enough. Frequently
an orchard is very
satisfactory. A hog-proof fence about 6
feet high will confine
the turkeys; they are
not likely to fly over
the fence, because
they cannot rest on
the top wire. Fences
should be tightly
stretched and should
be dog-proof, because
dogs and coyotes are
very destructive in
turkey flocks. Solid-top fences, gates, and
buildings less than 9
feet high should be topped with strips of poultry fence 3 feet wide to
prevent turkeys from perching on them. If turkey hens persist in
flying over the fence the flight feathers of one wing may be cut, but
the wing of a breeding male should never be clipped, as the clipping
may interfere with mating.</p>

<p>Sanitation in the breeding yards must not be neglected. Either
the fences and shelters should be made portable and moved each year
to clean ground, or double yards should be constructed for use only
in the breeding season, during which time one yard is occupied for
2 successive weeks and then the other, which in the meantime has been
kept free of all poultry.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 295px;"><a id="Figure_7"></a>
<img src="images/fig7.png" width="295" height="354" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 7.</span>&mdash;Slate turkey, male.]
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">« 9 »</a></span></p>

<p>If two or more breeding pens are maintained, they must be isolated
from each other. This can be done with double fences, 12 feet or
more apart, or with single fences built solid for about 3 feet above
the ground, so that the turkeys cannot see those in other pens.</p>


<h3><a id="MATING"></a>MATING</h3>

<p>Best results in mating are obtained when from 10 to 15 females
are mated to 1 male, although as many as 18 hens can be mated to 1
young tom under favorable conditions. As a rule good fertility
will result when several toms are kept with a flock of hens. However,
if the toms are quarrelsome and mating is seriously interfered with
the males must be alternated, 1 tom being allowed to run with the
hens 1 day and another tom the next day. Surplus toms should be
penned out of sight of the breeding birds.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 416px;"><a id="Figure_8"></a>
<img src="images/fig8.png" width="416" height="171" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 8.</span>&mdash;Breeding flock of Bronze turkeys on free range.</div>
</div>

<p>The soundest breeding program is one of using yearlings and
2-year-old hens which have been selected as breeders alter they have
passed through one full breeding season successfully. However, if
pedigreeing can be done, it is practicable to use well-matured pullets
selected from parents that lived through their first breeding season
and showed good production, fertility, hatchability, and poult livability.
The breeding males may be young or old but, in general,
well-matured young toms give better results. Proved sires, of course,
are valuable and can well be used so long as they will breed. Reserve
breeding toms should always be kept, especially when older
toms are used, as the latter are sometimes sterile. The spurs of a
yearling or older tom should be trimmed smooth, as should the toe-nails
of all breeding males, regardless of age, to avoid needless
tearing of the backs of the females.</p>

<p>All breeding hens and toms that are not to be used for another
breeding season should be marketed about June 1. If older hens
are used in breeding, it is advisable to replace 3-year-old females
with young birds, since egg production decreases rapidly after that
age. Immature stock should never be used but, as mentioned before,
well-matured young toms and pullets make good breeders especially
if trap nesting and pedigreeing can be carried on, thus enabling the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">« 10 »</a></span>
breeder to cull properly and sell as market birds the offspring of all
hens that die during their first laying season.</p>

<p>It is not advisable for the average producer to inbreed turkeys,
as this practice has been found to lower the vitality of the stock.
When only one breeding pen or flock is kept, it is advisable to obtain
new blood every season from a reliable outside source.</p>


<h3><a id="EGG_PRODUCTION"></a>EGG PRODUCTION</h3>

<p>The time of year at which turkeys naturally lay depends largely
on the climate of the region in which they are raised, being earliest
in the South. However, climate need not be permitted to hold back
egg production as artificial light can be used to obtain early eggs,
as with chickens. Soon after mating begins, the female looks for
a nesting place, and about 10 days after the first mating she begins
to lay. One nest should be provided for every 3 or 4 hens. The
number of eggs produced per bird depends on the breeding of the
stock as well as on management. Under ordinary circumstances in
the Northern States, young turkey hens should average 35 to 40 eggs
and yearling hens 25 to 30 eggs each during the normal breeding
season if they are broken up whenever broodiness occurs. By normal
breeding season is meant the time between the date the first egg is
laid (late in the winter or early in the spring) and June 1. If
artificial lights are used, starting about February 5, the breeders
should average 50 to 55 eggs each, or an increase of about 15 eggs by
June 1, due to the lighting. A few turkey raisers have used lights
in December or January, thereby securing very early hatched turkeys
and further increasing turkey-egg production.</p>

<p>Turkeys are not extensively trap-nested, but the practice is carried
on by producers who wish to pedigree the poults and carry on selective
breeding. One trap nest is needed for each two hens. The hens
should have free access to the trap nests before they start to lay, and
they should be carefully watched to see that they do not lay their
eggs anywhere except in the trap nests. Secluded places in the house
or yard should be eliminated. A simple form of trap nest is illustrated
in <a href="#Figure_9">figure 9</a>. The turkey enters at the front, through the trap
door, which closes automatically when the turkey is inside. The
door at the top of the coop is opened to release the bird from the
nest.</p>

<p>When incubators or chicken hens are used to hatch the eggs, the
turkey hens may be broken of their broodiness so that they will continue
laying. Breaking the hens of broodiness by confining them
to a wire-floored coop is very desirable because it permits the hatching
of a relatively large number of early turkeys and a larger number
from each hen. The birds hatched no later than June are the ones
that grow and mature most satisfactorily and therefore attain the
best size for the Thanksgiving and Christmas markets. Early
hatched birds should be marketed at Thanksgiving or before, and
those of later hatches can be used to supply the Christmas and New
Year demand. There is some demand for freshly dressed turkeys at
all times of the year. To meet this demand turkeys may be hatched
from eggs laid during summer and fall. By the use of artificial
light and proper feeds, hatchable eggs can be produced in the winter
and early in the spring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">« 11 »</a></span></p>

<p>It is natural for turkey hens to seek secluded places to lay their
eggs. Yards that have comparatively short vegetation and are free
from bushes or other places of concealment are best, because such
conditions discourage the birds from laying outside the nests provided
for them. A lookout for hidden nests must be maintained,
otherwise eggs may not be collected regularly and may be frozen,
partly incubated, or destroyed by animals. Sometimes the hidden
nests can be found by watching the turkey hens carefully as they
make their way to them, but an easier and quicker method is to confine
the hens early some morning soon after they come from the
roosts and then let them out about 2 p. m.; the laying hens will make
straight for their nests in order to lay the eggs they have been holding.
Nests are easily made of boxes or barrels placed inside the
shelter or outside in the yards. Some turkey growers prefer to
build nesting batteries with nests about 12 by 24 inches.</p>

inches; depth, 24 inches; height in front, 19 inches; and height in hack, 45 Inches.
The trap-nest fronts may be home-made, or commercial fronts may be used.</div>
</div>


<h3><a id="CARE_OF_HATCHING_EGGS"></a>CARE OF HATCHING EGGS</h3>

<p>Hatchability can be seriously damaged by holding eggs at temperatures
above 65° or below 35° F. It is most important to hold eggs
in a room that can be kept below 65°, preferably between 50° and
60°. Eggs should be collected several times daily and held on their
sides or on the small end. It is best to turn eggs gently once daily
while they are being held for hatching, but this is probably not necessary
unless they are to be kept longer than a week. For best results
they should not be held longer than 10 days but if they are held at a
suitable temperature and are turned once a day, fair hatchability will
be retained for as long as 3 weeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">« 12 »</a></span></p>


<h3><a id="FEEDING"></a>FEEDING</h3>

<p>Feeding young breeding turkeys is a matter of supplying a growing
ration in the fall and early in the winter, a laying ration late in the
winter and in the spring, and a maintenance ration during the summer.
Unless breeders are to be kept over for another year, they
should be marketed, if possible, about June 1 in order to reduce feed
costs and to aid in preventing the spread of blackhead and other
diseases that may affect adult turkeys during the summer. If
breeders are to be held over for the next season or until fall and if a
good summer and fall range is available well away from the growing
stock, the breeders are best carried through the summer on a daily
feeding of whole grain such as a mixture of equal parts of corn, oats,
and wheat. This mixture should be fed at the rate of one-fifth
pound per hen daily as a supplement to feed obtained from the range.
The toms, if ranged with the hens, should have access to grain in a
feeder too high for the hens to reach. A better method is to pen the
toms in a separate range lot and give them each one-half pound of
grain daily in troughs.</p>

<p>Breeding stock so managed during the summer respond economically
to a fattening diet offered in the fall. Beginning about 4
weeks before they are to be marketed, usually early in October, the
birds may be offered all they will eat daily of the grain mixture.
Within 4 weeks they will acquire a fine finish and make a gain in
weight of 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> pounds or more per hen and 4 pounds or more per tom.
About 5<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> pounds of grain per pound of gain is required for the
4-week fattening period. A little better finish is acquired in 6 weeks;
but the grade is not improved, and the gains are more expensive.
Breeding stock that are to be kept over should be held in the range
lots as long as possible and should also be fed liberally in the fall, in
order to put them in good condition for the winter.</p>

<p>Later in the fall and through the winter the rations for breeders,
especially young breeders, may be the same as the growing rations
normally fed to young stock. Scratch grain and a simple mash, such
as that suggested for growing poults, make a good feed for carrying
the breeders through the winter, since they meet the demands of the
birds for continued growth or for maintenance. If the climate is
such that green feed and sunshine are not available, as in the Northern
States, add 5 percent of alfalfa-leaf meal and 1 percent of cod-liver
oil to the mash. The birds should have all the mash and scratch
they will eat during the fall and winter. Breeders will not become
too fat if fed in accordance with this method. They will be fat, but
this is desirable if heavy egg production is expected.</p>

<p>For the production of large numbers of hatchable eggs turkeys
require a ration containing the various nutrients and vitamins. Good
results can be obtained with a simple laying ration, such as laying
mixture No. 1, if the birds get an abundance of fresh green feed and
have range. When ground oats or ground barley is included in any
mixture it should be finely ground. Alfalfa leaf meal should be
bright green in color. The cod-liver oil should be a standard good-quality
product, or the equivalent in fortified cod-liver oil may be
used if thoroughly mixed.</p>

<p>Laying mash should be kept before the birds at all times beginning
about a month before eggs are expected. Scratch mixture should
be fed in troughs, at the rate of one-fifth of a pound per day per bird,
so that the consumption during laying will be about equal parts of
the mash and scratch. The birds must have access to growing green
feed, direct sunshine, and water.</p>

<p>If the birds cannot obtain fresh succulent green feed and direct
sunshine in abundance, as in the case of those kept in confinement or in
cold climates, the ration must be more inclusive. Such a ration may
be compounded as follows:</p>

<p>As with the simpler ration, the mash should be kept before the
birds at all times, and the scratch can be hand-fed in troughs at the

as an all-mash ration with good results. The all-mash formula is as

<p>This all-mash mixture is kept before the breeders at all times.
Just enough to carry the birds through each day should be given. In
this way its freshness is assured, an important consideration in all-mash
feeding.</p>

<p>If desired, the oyster shell or limestone may be fed separately in
hoppers, but mixing it in the mash saves labor and prevents excessive
consumption. Gravel or granite grit should be provided to furnish
grinding material. Clean water, placed in contamination-proof vessels,
should be provided at all times. Alfalfa hay probably cannot be
depended upon to supply adequate amounts of green-feed substitute
for hatching-egg production. Only by fresh green feed or green-feed
substitutes and fish oils can those requirements be met. The
oil should be freshly mixed in the feed every week or two.</p>

<p>All feed should be fed in feeders, never on the ground or in the
litter. Feeders should be constructed so as to prevent waste and
contamination with droppings. Turkey hens consume a little less
than one-half pound of mash and scratch grain per day when practically
all of their feed is furnished. Toms consume about 0.7 pound
daily; eating mostly scratch grains.</p>


<h3><a id="COMBATING_DISEASES"></a>COMBATING DISEASES AND PESTS</h3>

<p>Turkey raisers, to be permanently successful, must follow some
system of sanitation. Many growers have prevented disease and the
attacks of parasites in their flocks by providing range on clean soil;
that is, soil on which no poultry manure has been spread; feeding
their birds from feeders that cannot be contaminated by droppings;
and keeping the quarters sanitary at all times. <i>Separation of the
turkeys from chickens and other poultry at all times is essential.</i></p>

<p>Diseases and parasites of turkeys are discussed in detail in
Farmers' Bulletin 1652, Diseases and Parasites of Poultry. Coccidiosis
often causes heavy losses in young turkeys. It is best combated
by carefully cleaning the brooder house and changing the
litter once a week during the brooding period, keeping the litter
dry, and using wire-covered feeding platforms. Turkeys are subject
also to the attacks of various species of worms, but treatment for
worms should not be undertaken until the presence of worms has
been determined by examining the droppings or by post-mortem
examination.</p>

<h4>BLACKHEAD</h4>

<p>Although other infectious diseases sometimes affect turkeys, blackhead
is by far the most destructive ailment. It is caused by one of
the Protozoa and is primarily a disease of the caeca (the blind
pouches of the intestines) and the liver, but the fact that the head
of the affected bird often becomes discolored has given the disease
its common name, blackhead. It attacks turkeys most frequently,
but chicks are often affected by it without showing symptoms; thus
the chickens carry and spread the infection to turkeys when allowed
to range with them. A combination of spotted liver and ulcerated
caeca indicates that the birds have blackhead infection.</p>

<p>Although blackhead affects adult turkeys, it occurs principally
among poults between the ages of 6 weeks and 6 months. It is found
to a greater or lesser extent throughout the United States. The turkeys
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">« 15 »</a></span>
affected by blackhead, like all birds having infectious diseases,
should be removed immediately from the flock to prevent the spread
of the disease. The best procedure is to kill the sick birds and burn
or bury the bodies, as no treatment has been found satisfactory.
Move the flock to clean ground, if possible; but if this cannot be
done, clean out and disinfect the roosting place, plow the ground in
the yards, and install a system of yard sanitation. Keep chickens
and all other poultry away from turkey yards at all times in order
to prevent infection from this source. The organisms which cause
the disease may be carried by flies, blown with dust, conveyed in
contaminated soil on the feet of the caretaker, or spread for considerable
distances in other ways.</p>

<p>Several measures for preventing blackhead are practiced, the chief
of which are: (1) Obtaining eggs or stock from flocks known to be
healthy; (2) quarantining and worming all new stock; (3) cleaning
and changing the litter at least weekly during the brooding period;
(4) keeping both young and mature turkeys on clean ground at a
considerable distance from chickens; (5) excluding, so far as possible,
pigeons, sparrows, and persons from the turkey houses and
yards; (6) frequently cleaning and occasionally disinfecting growing
houses, feed troughs, and all other equipment; (7) feeding only
in clean feeders, never on the ground; (8) immediately killing and
deeply burying or completely burning all diseased birds; and (9)
eliminating all stagnant water pools where the turkeys range. Clean
range, clean quarters, clean feed, and clean water are most important.</p>

<h4>LICE AND MITES</h4>

<p>Lice may cause high mortality among young poults, those badly
infested gradually becoming weaker until they die. Head lice are
the most troublesome and are found close to the skin near the top
of the head, above and in front of the eyes, and under the throat.
Applying an insect powder, preferably sodium fluoride, when the
hen is set, is an easy method of preventing lice from getting a start
among poults. Apply the sodium fluoride among the leathers, working
it well down next to the skin, 1 pinch on the head, 1 on the neck,
2 on the back, 1 on the breast, 1 below the vent, 1 at the base of the
tail, 1 on each thigh, and 1 scattered on the underside of each wing
when spread. If this treatment is not applied, hen-hatched poults
are almost certain to have lice.</p>

<p>If the hen has been treated in this manner before being set and
the poults are not exposed to infested stock or premises, they will
remain free from lice indefinitely. It is well, however, to examine
the poults occasionally and, if lice are found, to apply sodium fluoride
sparingly. It should not be applied until the poults are at least
a week old, and then only two very small pinches should be used.
Distribute one of these on the neck, the top of the head, and the
throat, and the other on the back and below the vent. After the
poults are old enough to roost, control lice by applying nicotine
sulphate solution in a thin line on the top surface of the roosts.
Repeat as often as necessary to keep down the lice and be sure that
each bird is exposed to the treatment. Sodium fluoride applied as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">« 16 »</a></span>
directed for delousing setting hens or as a dip will completely
eliminate all species of lice from mature stock.</p>

<p>The dipping method consists in immersing mature fowls in a large
tub of solution made by mixing 1 ounce or sodium fluoride to each
gallon of tepid water. Immerse the birds for only a few seconds,
raising the feathers at the same time to allow the dip to penetrate
to the skin. Dip the birds on a warm day, preferably in the morning,
so as to give them time to dry before night.</p>

<p>Destroy red mites in the roosting quarters by painting the under
side of the roosts and the roost supports with anthracene oil, crude
oil, crank-case oil, or any coal-tar disinfectant. Make the application
light but thorough, and do it preferably in the morning.</p>

<p>The fowl tick or blue bug is one of the worst pests of turkeys in
the Southwest. It can be controlled by the methods advised for
controlling red mites.</p>

<h4>PROTECTION FROM COLD, DAMPNESS, AND ENEMIES</h4>

<p>Protection from adverse weather conditions and enemies is required
if turkeys are to be raised successfully. An open-front shed
with a reasonably tight roof and dry floor, so arranged that the
north, west, and east sides can be closed against storms, will give
ample protection for full-grown turkeys. Boosts may be made from
good-sized poles or 2 by 4's nailed flat to supports which should be
slightly higher at the rear than at the front, where they should be
about 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> feet above the floor. The space between the roosts should
be about 2 feet and the space underneath enclosed with poultry
wire. In the southern part of the United States there is little need
for well-built turkey houses, but during damp, cold, or stormy
weather the turkeys should have protection of some kind. They
should not be exposed to dampness, but they can stand a considerable
amount of dry cold.</p>

<p>In many localities protection from dogs must be provided in some
way. High roosts or well-built shelters provide this at night. Keeping
the birds confined to high roosts or in dog-proof shelters at night
and during the early morning hours gives a good protection. An
attendant or a good watchdog is needed to protect the turkeys when
they are off their roosts or out of their shelters.</p>

<h2><a name="INCUBATING_TURKEY_EGGS" id="INCUBATING_TURKEY_EGGS">INCUBATING TURKEY EGGS</a></h2>


<p>The vigor of the breeding stock, the manner in which it has been
fed and managed, and the care given the eggs will determine to a
high degree the hatchability of the eggs. An important measure of
success in turkey raising is the number of fully matured turkeys
raised in proportion to the number of hens in the breeding flock.
An average of 25 mature birds raised per hen is considered very good
in well-managed turkey flocks, whereas in most general-farm flocks
10 to 15 mature birds per hen would be a good average.</p>

<p>The period of incubation of turkey eggs is 28 days, and the method
is much the same as that used with chicken eggs. Turkey eggs can
be successfully hatched by turkey hens or chicken hens, or in incubators.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">« 17 »</a></span>
Hatching in incubators is best and is coming into more general
use, especially on farms and ranches where turkeys are raised in
large numbers. Turkeys hatched and reared by hens, especially
chicken hens, are likely to contract disease and become infested with
parasites at an early age. Sitting turkey hens can cover from 15 to
18 eggs; chicken hens, from 7 to 10 eggs.</p>


<h3><a id="NATURAL_INCUBATION"></a>NATURAL INCUBATION</h3>

<p>Hatching the eggs under turkey hens is widely practiced and is
often the most practical method. When the turkey hen becomes
broody and has remained consistently on the nest for 2 or 3 days, she
should be given her eggs. If several turkey hens are sitting at the
same time, care should be taken that each gets back into her own nest.
Nests are most conveniently arranged on the ground, in boxes about
2 feet square or in barrels. If rats are a menace, the nest should
furnish protection against them and should always be made proof
against larger animals so that the turkey hens will not be disturbed
or the eggs destroyed. The nests should be flat and shallow, as deep
nests may result in crushed eggs or crushed baby poults. Nests with
damp sod bottoms and only a little straw to keep the eggs from rolling
into the corners are generally satisfactory. Nesting batteries in
which each hen is provided with a small individual run so that she
can get off and on the nest at will are very good. With this method
the only care necessary is to see that feed and water are always before
the hens and that each one remains broody. If individual runs are
not provided, the hens should be taken off daily, allowed to exercise
and eat, and then returned to their own nests. Plenty of water to
drink and clean, wholesome grain feed, such as a mixture of wheat,
oats, and corn, should be provided, and fresh green feed or good
alfalfa hay should be made available.</p>

<p>Turkey or chicken hens, before being set on turkey eggs, should
be treated with sodium fluoride, as previously directed.</p>


<h3><a id="ARTIFICIAL_INCUBATION"></a>ARTIFICIAL INCUBATION</h3>

<p>Correct incubator temperatures are much the same for turkey eggs
as for chicken eggs, but the greater size of the turkey eggs may
necessitate some adjustment of the apparatus used in measuring the
temperature. This is true in nearly all kinds of incubators except
those of the forced-draft type. The relative position of the thermometer
in the egg chamber is important in the accuracy with which
it records the temperature. For hatching turkey eggs the proper
position of the thermometer is usually indicated in the directions
that are furnished by the manufacturer of the incubator. As a general
rule, with the bottom of the bulb 1<sup>7</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inches above the egg tray,
the thermometer should read 100.5° F. for the first week, 101.5° the
second, 102.5° the third, and 103° the last week. Forced-draft incubators
are usually run at about 99.5°. Temperature can best
be regulated, however, by using the thermometer that goes with
the machine, placing it in the position recommended by the manufacturer,
and then following the manufacturer's instructions for
hatching turkey eggs, making sure that the egg trays do not sag.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">« 18 »</a></span></p>

<p>Turkey eggs lose about 3.5 percent less moisture during incubation
than do chicken eggs, notwithstanding the fact that turkey eggs require
about 7 days longer to hatch. Excellent hatches have been
obtained when the loss of moisture based on the weight of the eggs
just before they were set, ranged within the following limits: After
6 days of incubation, 2 to 8 percent; after 12 days of incubation.
4.1 to 6 percent; after 18 days of incubation, 6.2 to 9 percent; and
after 24 days of incubation, 9 to 12 percent.</p>

<p>On this basis, a dozen turkey eggs of normal size should lose about
1 ounce for every 6 days of incubation. The air cells of turkey eggs
are smaller in proportion to the size of the eggs than are those of
chicken eggs because normal evaporation in turkey eggs during incubation
is considerably less than that in chicken eggs. When more
moisture is needed in the incubator it can be provided by putting in
water pans, or by placing burlap wicks in the pans. When less moisture
is needed the water pans may be removed or the ventilation
increased.</p>

<p>As a rule the eggs should be turned at least 3 and preferably 4 to
6 times daily. Four times daily, every 6 hours, day and night, is an
excellent plan. They should be tested preferably on the eighth or
ninth and again on the twentieth to twenty-second days, and all infertile
eggs and those having dead germs should be removed. Cooling
the eggs once or twice a day until they feel slightly cool to the
face may be of value in small incubators. Turning and cooling
should be discontinued about the twenty-third day, and the incubator
door should be darkened and kept closed until hatching is
completed. The poults may then be left in the incubators for about
24 hours or else put in the brooder and fed as soon as hatching is
completed and the poults thoroughly dried off. Poults held in the
incubator should be kept at about 95° F. and should have a rough
surface such as <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>-inch-mesh hardware cloth to stand on. Keeping
the incubator dark helps to keep the poults quiet and tends to prevent
spraddle legs. There is no good reason for withholding feed
longer than 24 hours. If feed is withheld for a much longer period
when the poults are in the brooder, they may eat the litter. Therefore,
poults should be fed when they are put in the brooder house.</p>

<p>Shipping day-old poults in specially built strawboard boxes has
been found to be satisfactory. The container is larger than that ordinarily
used for baby chicks, 60 poults commonly being placed in
each box.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="RAISING_POULTS" id="RAISING_POULTS">RAISING POULTS</a></h2>


<p>There are few turkey-raising problems so important as brooding
and rearing the poults, because the greatest losses in turkey raising
usually occur in the first few weeks of the birds' lives. Heavy mortality
among the poults may indicate that the breeding stock used
was low in vitality or was poorly managed, but it more often indicates
poor feeding or management of the poults. The importance
of keeping both the poults and the breeding turkeys on ground free
from infection and away from chickens cannot be overemphasized.
Improper brooding methods cause great losses, because turkey poults
are very susceptible to cold, dampness, overcrowding, overheating,
unsuitable feeds, and unsuitable litter, and they succumb readily to
attacks of diseases and parasites.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">« 19 »</a></span></p>


<h3><a id="BROODING"></a>BROODING</h3>

<p>The poults may be brooded naturally by turkey hens or artificially
by brooders. Brooding by turkey hens provides a never-failing
source of heat, allows the poults to be raised in small flocks, and permits
taking advantage of free-range conditions. Its disadvantages
are that the young turkeys may contract disease or become infected
with parasites from the hens and they may wander too far and be
killed by storms or predatory animals. Artificial brooding makes it
easier to maintain proper sanitation, keeps down costs, puts the poults
more directly under the control of the operator, and is more adaptable
to large-scale production.</p>

<h4>NATURAL BROODING</h4>

<div class="fig_right" style="width: 280px;"><a id="Figure_10"></a>
<img src="images/fig10.png" width="280" height="277" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 10.</span>&mdash;A well-built brood coop which can be used
either for setting a turkey hen or for raising a brood of poults.</div>
</div>

<p>Brooding poults by turkey hens is not difficult, although several
details should receive careful attention. As soon as the hatch is
completed and the poults begin to run out from under the sitting
hen, transfer the hen
and her brood to a
coop. A coop of simple
design, such as the
<b>A</b>-shaped type (<a href="#Figure_10">fig. 10</a>), large enough to
accommodate a turkey
hen comfortably, and
well built to protect
the brood from rains
and natural enemies,
is all that is required.
It should be about 5
feet long, 3 feet wide,
and 3 feet high, with
a raised, rat-proof
floor. Provide good-sized
screened openings
for ventilation in
hot weather. These
openings should be so
fixed that rain will
not beat into the coop. Have a separate coop
for each hen, and if
there are several broods, place the coops some distance apart on well-drained
soil where the grass is fairly short.</p>

<p>For the first day or so it is well to confine the poults in the coop
with the mother hen. Then make a small yard, using boards or wire
around the front of the coop, and allow the poults to run in and
out at will. However, they should not be allowed to run in long,
wet grass, and during heavy rains they should be confined to the
coop. Move the coop and yard to fresh ground every few days, clean
it once a week or more frequently, and disinfect it occasionally.
When the poults are about a week old the mother hen may be allowed
to roam with her brood, but care should be taken to see that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">« 20 »</a></span>
entire brood returns in the evening and is protected at night from
predatory animals. Good results may be obtained by keeping the
mother hens confined and allowing the poults to range, but the brood
should be properly sheltered during rainstorms or damp weather,
which are likely to cause high mortality. The poults may be kept
with the mother hen for 3 months or more, but better results are
usually obtained by moving them to a separate rearing field on clean
ground when they are from 8 to 10 weeks old. If they have shelter
and will roost, they are better off without the hens after that age.
A turkey hen will raise up to 20 poults successfully, but more than
20 can sometimes be placed with a hen in warm weather.</p>

<h4>ARTIFICIAL BROODING</h4>

<p>The practice of brooding poults artificially is becoming more popular
and is usually more successful than brooding with turkey hens.
The methods used in artificial brooding are very similar to those used
in raising chicks, which are discussed in Farmers' Bulletin 1538,
Incubation and Brooding of Chickens. However, one point of great
importance in brooding poults artificially is to make sure that they
do not crowd together while in the brooder house. This can be
avoided by frequent attention, by providing an even temperature,
and by having good ventilation in the brooder house. A colony
house or permanent brooder house that is suitable for brooding chicks
is equally suitable for turkeys, but fewer birds should be put in the
house, as turkey poults are larger than chicks. Between 75 and 125
poults should be placed under one 52-inch hover in the average
colony brooder House. Larger hovers and larger brooding rooms will
accommodate 225 poults or more, but only an experienced operator
should attempt; to raise groups larger than 150. The prevailing
custom is to use brooder stoves in portable colony houses or permanent
brooding quarters.</p>

<p>The colony houses may be moved several times each season, thereby
giving the poults plenty of free range on clean soil. Since blackhead
is closely associated with insanitary conditions, special effort must
be made to keep the houses, runs, and yards clean. If permanent
brooder houses are used, a floor of concrete from 12 to 14 feet wide
or a small gravel or cinder-floored yard is often used in front of the
house. A skeleton framework covered with to 1-inch-mesh wire
may also be used to floor the outside run either with the permanent
brooder houses or with the colony houses (<a href="#Figure_11">fig. 11</a>). Poults are
regularly confined to this small yard for the first 8 weeks and in some
cases have been successfully reared to market age in it. However,
a clean yard containing growing green feed is an advantage in brooding.
If it is used only for about 8 weeks each year, there seems little
danger of contamination.</p>

<p>The brooder and brooder house should be operated to keep the
young turkeys comfortable. A dim light under or above the hover
at night has a quieting effect on the poults. The temperature should
be high enough to keep the poults comfortable but not high enough
to be detrimental to their health. When the poults are first put into
the colony house with the brooder stove, the temperature 3 inches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">« 21 »</a></span>
above the floor under the hover should be from, 95° to 110° F. This
temperature should be lowered gradually as the poults get larger
until they are 6 or 8 weeks old, when they require little or no heat,
especially in the daytime. It is a common practice in cold weather
to keep the general room temperature at the floor rather high, about
75°, to prevent crowding. The exact temperature, however, is of
minor importance provided the poults are kept comfortable and good
ventilation is maintained. The poults, if comfortable, will be active
and contented. This is the real test of temperature. All warm
points and surfaces except those at the brooder itself should be
eliminated. Free access from all parts of the brooder room to the
hover must be provided. All corners in the brooding room, especially
back of the hover, should be rounded, preferably by using <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>-inch-mesh
poultry wire. A fence of the same material should be set up
around the hover for the first 2 or 3 days until the poults become
accustomed to their surroundings and learn to return to the source of
heat. Flat roosts 2 to 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inches wide and slightly tilted up at the
rear may be placed at graduated levels in the brooder house when
the poults are from 2 to 3 weeks old, to encourage them to begin
roosting at an early age. This provision lessens the danger of night
crowding. The front roost should be 6 inches above the floor and
each of the others a few inches higher than the one in front of it
and about 8<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inches apart, center to center.</p>

</div>


<h3><a id="SANITATION"></a>SANITATION</h3>

<p>The brooder house should be thoroughly cleaned and the litter
changed once every 7 days, or oftener if disease occurs, regardless of
the type of litter used. This cleaning schedule must be adhered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">« 22 »</a></span>
to rigidly if blackhead, coccidiosis, and other diseases are to be
prevented.</p>

<p>Thoroughly clean and disinfect brooder houses and equipment
used for turkeys at the end of each brooding season or oftener if
disease occurs. First clean the house thoroughly and burn all
litter and droppings or haul them to land that is not to be used for
poultry and from which there will be no drainage into the turkey
range. Then scrub the floor and sides of the house, if it is of board
construction, with boiling hot lye solution (one-third of a can to
a pail of water) and allow them to dry out. Next, thoroughly
spray the entire inside of the building with a 3- or 4-percent solution
of cresol compound or any other approved disinfectant. Give
the same treatment once a year to the quarters occupied by the breeding
stock. The "fire gun", a large kerosene torch which involves
the blow-torch principle, has proved to be valuable in disinfecting,
if it is properly used and the house has been thoroughly cleaned.</p>


<h3><a id="LITTER"></a>LITTER</h3>

<p>Sand or gravel is recommended for litter for the first 2 or 3
weeks; after that, clean wheat straw is advised as a means of saving
labor. Gravel or sand makes the best litter; but with large flocks,
using it for more than 2 or 3 weeks may require too much labor.
Straw or hay, if used during the first 2 weeks, may cause a stunting
of growth and a high mortality. Many growers have been successful
in using, as a substitute for litter, <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>-inch wire mesh stretched
tightly a few inches above the floor of the house, but it requires
much labor to clean this, and it seems to have no advantage over
clean litter. A wire-floored sun porch makes a good substitute,
for an outside yard during the brooding period although, as previously
stated, a clean yard in grass is preferable.</p>


<h3><a id="EARLY_DEVELOPMENT"></a>EARLY DEVELOPMENT</h3>

<p>The poults, when first hatched, are covered with soft down. When
they are about 10 days old, feathers begin to appear where the wings
join the body, and in about 3 weeks the tail feathers begin to appear.
From then on feather growth is rapid, and when the poults are 2
months old they are well feathered. About the fifth week fleshy
protuberances called caruncles begin to appear, and by the seventh
week they begin to extend down the neck. The appearance of caruncles
in the poults is termed "shooting the red." On the top of
the head of both males and females a fleshy protuberance develops
into what is called the "dew bill" or "snood"; on males it is larger
and more elastic than on females.</p>

<p>The sex of young turkeys can be distinguished by the appearance
of a tuft of hairs on the breast of males between 3 and 4 months old.
The tuft usually does not appear on the breasts of the females until
they are much older, and the hairs of the tuft are shorter and finer
than those on males. The hock joints on the males are much broader
and heavier than on the females. The sex of well-grown Bronze
turkey poults can be distinguished by examining the mature breast
feathers which appear at 12 to 14 weeks. Those of the males are
bronze black with no white, whereas the tip of those of the females
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">« 23 »</a></span>
have a narrow white edge. Day-old poults may be sexed as is done
with baby chicks by examining that part of the sex organs that can be
seen at the vent.</p>


<h3><a id="MARKING"></a>MARKING</h3>

<p>When large numbers of turkeys are raised it is advisable to adopt
some system of marking the poults that enables the grower to keep
a record of the age and breeding of the different broods, as this is
of assistance in selecting early hatched birds for breeding and slaughter
purposes. Such a system also makes it possible to separate the
poults out of special matings from the rest of the flock or from
neighboring flocks. The poults may be marked by punching holes
in the webs between the toes or slitting these webs. Different webs
may be punched or slit for different broods, and thus provide a
record of all turkeys raised.</p>

<p>Heavy, aluminum, clinch pigeon-wing bands are well adapted for
marking young turkeys. The bands can be applied in two ways:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>According to the first, the band is first made round and clinched,
then slipped over the baby poult's toes and flattened so that it will
not come off but at the same time will allow for some growth of the
leg. When the poult is about 4 weeks old the band is transferred
to the wing by unclinching and inserting it in a hole made in the
middle of the web between the first and second joints of the wing
and about one-fourth inch from the edge. The band is again
clinched and made round so that it is not easily flattened and its
lettering can be read easily. According to the second method of
application the band is put directly into the wing at hatching time,
a thin knife blade being used to make the hole for the band, near
the edge of the web and midway between the joints of the wing.
Turkey poults, when good sized, may be tattooed on the wing for
identification. When the breeding turkeys are selected as they approach
maturity, heavy wing bands or heavy permanent leg bands
may be used if the birds were not marked at an earlier age.</p></div>


<h3><a id="FEEDING_GROWING_TURKEYS"></a>FEEDING GROWING TURKEYS</h3>

<p>Success in turkey raising depends mainly upon the combination
of feeds given the young poults. Poor-quality feeds, lack of vitamins,
and shortage of proteins, especially if the poults are closely
confined, are the more common causes or failures. Some difficulty
may be experienced in getting artificially brooded poults to eat, as
a young poult is much less active than a chick; but if several small
troughs are provided there should be no serious trouble from this
cause. Dipping the beaks of backward poults in milk or water, or
feeding oatmeal flakes may induce them to eat. Poults brooded with
hens, of course, do not need this special attention.</p>

<p>After the poults are from 6 to 8 weeks old they may get some of
their living from a good range, but the use of additional feed, preferably
a balanced ration of mash and scratch grain, will give better
growth and result in early maturity and greater returns above feed
cost.</p>

<p>In natural brooding the turkey hen, while confined to the coop,
should be fed mash and given some tender green feed. Water and
gravel or grit should, of course, be kept before her all the time.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">« 24 »</a></span>
In feeding the hen and her brood it is advisable to feed the poults
outside the coop and the hen inside in order to prevent the hen from
wasting the feed intended for the poults.</p>

<p>For the first 24 to 72 hours after hatching, poults can live without
feed, the yolk of the egg which they absorb before hatching being
sufficient to maintain them for that length of time. As soon as they
are put into the brooder house or with the hen they should be fed.
If they are not fed for the first day or two they should be kept in
a darkened coop or incubator. However, leaving the poults in a
darkened incubator for only 12 to 24 hours and feeding them as soon
as they are removed to the brooder seems to be better and is now
becoming a general practice.</p>

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 12.</span>&mdash;Cross section of trough feeders for turkey poults of various ages; <i>A</i>, Lath
feeder for first week; <i>B</i>, feeder for second to fourth weeks; <i>C</i>, feeder for fifth to twelfth
weeks. Feeder <i>C</i> will give better results if equipped with a reel, at the top, similar to
that shown in <a href="#Figure_14">figure 14</a>.</div>
</div>


<p>The first feed may be a mixture of finely chopped, tender green
feed, and dry starting mash. Hard-boiled eggs, ground or crumbled,
may also be added if desired. This feed should be placed on clean
boards or in little feeders made of laths as illustrated in <a href="#Figure_12">figure 12</a>.
It is a good plan to keep the feed before the poults at all times from
the very beginning so that the backward poults will learn to eat
and their growth rate will not be retarded. Milk, if not too high
priced, may be kept before them in easily cleaned crockery, tin,
wooden, or graniteware receptacles which the poults cannot get into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">« 25 »</a></span>
or contaminate. After the first few days the green feed, unless it is
available in the yards, may be spread on top of the mash in the
feeders. Turkey poults appear to be easily harmed by eating large
quantities of tough, fibrous litter or green feed; hence the selection
of a tender green feed is most important.</p>

<h4>FEEDING DURING THE FIRST 6 TO 8 WEEKS</h4>

<p>The use of a well-balanced, all-mash ration is the simplest and most
practical method of feeding poults during the first few weeks of their
lives. Many commercial starting mashes are available or good home-mixed
mashes may be used with excellent success. The protein, mineral,
and vitamin contents are the main points to be considered. Milk
in some form is very desirable, dried milk being preferable. Liquid
milk is a fair feed, but the dried form is preferable at least for starting
rations.</p>

<p>The following starting mashes are recommended for feeding turkey
poults during the first 6 to 8 weeks. Mash No. 1, fed without liquid
milk, is preferable.</p>

<p>Starting mash No. 2 is advised for feeding when liquid skim milk
or buttermilk is kept before the poults at all times. Some water is
furnished, allowing one dish of water to several of milk. These starting
mashes are fed without scratch grain; but water, green feed, and
hard grit such as fine gravel, coarse sand, or commercial granite
grit should be supplied. The green feed should be chopped fine and
scattered on top of the mash in the feeders once or twice daily, allowing
all the poults will consume in about half an hour. Tender
alfalfa tops, onion tops, lettuce, and tender, short lawn clippings,
preferably those containing clover, are all good feeds. Tough green
feed should be avoided as it may cause impaction. Green feed as
picked by the birds from the yards is most desirable. In that case
hand feeding is not necessary. The mash in dry form should be
kept before the poults at all times, but only enough mash to last for
a day or two should be supplied at one time. About 1 inch of feeder
space per poult (including both sides of the feeders) is desirable.
This should be increased to 2 or 3 inches after about 2 or 3 weeks.
Plans for feeders are shown in <a href="#Figure_12">figure 12</a>.</p>

<h4>FEEDING FROM 6 TO 8 WEEKS TO MARKETING TIME</h4>

<p>Rations for growing the poults after the age of 6 to 8 weeks may
include mash and whole grain or liquid milk and whole grain. Many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">« 26 »</a></span>
turkeys are grown and fattened on grain supplemented with whatever
insects and green feed can be obtained from the range. A better
plan is to provide sufficient protein and minerals to give normal
growth. The minimum feeding advised is to allow each day one
liberal feeding of a 20-percent protein mash, or to furnish all the milk
the birds will drink with a feeding of whole grain. Either the mash
or the liquid milk should be used with liberal feedings of whole grain
for fattening in the fall.</p>

<p>Good growing mashes suitable for different conditions may be made
as follows:</p>

<p>These growing mashes are all fed with scratch grains consisting of
such grains as corn, wheat, barley, and oats. Corn, wheat, or barley
may be used as the only scratch grain except with growing mash No. 4,
which should contain from 50 to 75 percent of oats. A good grain
mixture may be made of 40 parts of corn, 40 parts of wheat, and 20
parts of oats. Mashes 1 and 2 are for flocks having access to a good
green range. In mash No. 2 soybean oil meal, which has proved to
be a good source of protein and is also good for fattening, is substituted
for meat scrap. Mash No. 3 is a more complete ration and is
advised for all conditions where the turkeys do not have an abundance
of growing green feed.</p>

<p>Other combinations of grains and byproducts may be used successfully,
the exact selection depending largely on availability and cost
of feeds. It is best to use at least two grains, and preferably three or
four, in the ration. Corn is the grain most commonly used in feeding
turkeys. Not more than 60 percent of the entire growing ration
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">« 27 »</a></span>
should consist of oats or barley or a combination of the two. Yellow
corn tends to produce a deep-yellow skin color while white corn,
barley, and wheat produce turkeys with light-colored skins.</p>

<p>If the birds have all the milk they will drink along with whole
grains, they will consume enough milk to make good growth, if no
water is fed. A mixture of 30 percent of corn, 30 percent of oats,
20 percent of wheat, and 20 percent of barley is satisfactory; so is
a free choice of several grains. However, the whole-grain and
liquid-milk method works well only when the birds are on a good,
green range and is practical to use only when milk products are
cheap. Some loss from pendulous crops is to be expected when liquid
milk is consumed liberally and this is one of the chief objections to
its use. The milk receptacles should be set on a wire screen and covered
to protect them from the weather and from contamination with
droppings. Sanitation is especially important when milk is used.</p>

<h4><a id="GENERAL_SUGGESTIONS"></a>GENERAL SUGGESTIONS FOR FEEDING</h4>

<p>Feed should be kept before the birds constantly from hatching to
market age. During the first 6 weeks feed starting mash. During
the seventh and eighth weeks feed a mixture of equal parts of the
starting and growing mashes. From 9 to 12 weeks feed the growing
mash. From 13 weeks to marketing feed growing mash and scratch
grain. No scratch grain is fed during the first 12 weeks. If a
change is made from mash to the whole-grain and liquid-milk
method, cut down the mash gradually until the poults learn to drink
the milk and to eat the whole grain freely.</p>

<p>Cod-liver oil is necessary in starting rations, but as a rule it is
not necessary in a growing ration unless the birds are confined. In
that case, about 1 percent should be added to the mash. A good grade
of plain cod-liver oil is advised for use in turkey feeds. Fish meal,
though an excellent feed, may impart an undesirable flavor to turkey
meat. Fish meal and cod-liver oil should be omitted from the fattening
ration during the last 8 weeks before the birds are marketed.
Birds should not be moved, or feeding arrangements radically
changed in the last 6 weeks before marketing.</p>

<p>Feeding the growing mash wet is a common practice in some
localities. Like the dry-mash and scratch-grain system, it produces
fine-quality turkeys although the labor in feeding may be greater.
With this method the turkeys are fed all they will eat of a moist,
crumbly mash placed in troughs with sufficient trough space provided
to accommodate all the flock at one time. Only as much mash as
the birds will clean up in 30 to 60 minutes is fed twice daily. Tail
picking seldom occurs during moist-mash feeding if the ration is
complete.</p>

<p>Grit may be furnished in the form of commercial granite grit or
coarse sand for little poults and fine gravel for the larger birds.
Limestone grit does not serve well as grinding material and is
unnecessary with the rations as listed.</p>

<p>The poults may be put on the rearing ground when they are from
8 to 12 weeks old. An alfalfa field is an ideal rearing ground and
may be used as a permanent, fenced, rearing range divided into 2
or 3 sections. When the rearing range is divided into 2 sections,
1 may be used for 2 seasons in succession while the other is rested
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">« 28 »</a></span>
for 2 seasons. A better plan is to divide it into 3 parts, allowing
1 season's use followed by 2 seasons' rest for each of the 3 sections.
With portable houses and fences a method known as the "Minnesota
plan" (<a href="#Page_37">p. 37</a>) permits the turkey poults to be moved to a new section
once a week and to an entirely new plot each year. Land on which
no poultry of any kind have run for 2 years and on which no poultry
manure has been spread, may be considered clean ground. The feed
should not be put on the ground but in hoppers or troughs which
should be moved frequently or set on wire-covered framework to
prevent contamination with droppings. It is very important that
the drinking water be fresh and clean and that the growing turkeys
should not have access to stagnant water pools. Watering dishes
should be placed on wire-covered platforms with a device to prevent
contamination from the birds' perching on the top or sides.</p>

<p>The limited-range method with full feeding, as described, is recommended
in preference to free range with limited feeding. However,
conditions sometimes demand that free range be permitted, and
limited feeding practiced. In such cases, when natural feed is
abundant, good results can be obtained by feeding the poults, after
they are from 8 to 10 weeks old, only once daily, as previously
suggested. Any of the growing mashes previously listed should make
a good supplement to range feeds. This extra feed will tend to
keep the birds nearer home and keep them growing at a reasonably
good rate. Scratch grains should also be fed and as marketing time
approaches, will be eaten more liberally by the birds. For turkeys
on free range, plenty of water in convenient locations should be
provided. Water helps to maintain good health and may help to
prevent the condition known as "crop bound."</p>

<p>Turkeys which are well fed should make increases in weight comparable
to those given in <a href="#Table_2">table 2</a>, which gives the average weights,
at various ages, ox Bronze turkeys raised in an experiment conducted
at the United States Range Livestock Experiment Station at Miles
City, Mont. These birds were fed starting and growing mashes containing
about 22 percent of protein.</p>

<h3><a id="FEED_CONSUMPTION"></a>FEED CONSUMPTION AND COST OF GROWING</h3>

<p>The quantity and cost of feed used in raising a flock of 156 Bronze
turkeys in Montana in 1934 are shown in tables <a href="#Table_3">3</a> and <a href="#Table_4">4</a>. These poults
(70 males and 86 females) had well-balanced dry mashes (containing
22 percent of protein) before them at all times and scratch grain beginning
with the second week. The birds were allowed to range on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">« 29 »</a></span>
2-acre nonirrigated lots after they were 8 weeks of age. The costs
were based on local feed prices in Miles City, Mont., in 1934. By
using the data in tables <a href="#Table_2">2</a> and <a href="#Table_3">3</a>, the feed consumption and cost for
an average turkey can be estimated for any period of growth.</p>

<p>Using the data contained in tables <a href="#Table_2">2</a> and <a href="#Table_3">3</a>, it will be found that
it took approximately 96 pounds of mash and scratch feed to raise a
21-pound tom to 28 weeks of age, and about 57<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> pounds of mash
and grain to raise a 12<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>-pound hen to that age, or about 4.6 pounds
of feed for each pound of live weight, when practically all feed was
furnished. It took about 4 pounds of feed for each pound of live
weight up to 24 weeks of age. The birds had access to a moderate
sized range lot containing native grasses, but very little feed was obtained
from it during the 1934 season.</p>

<h3><a id="DEFORMED_BREASTBONES"></a>DEFORMED BREASTBONES</h3>

<p>Crooked and dented breastbones in turkeys are common and sometimes
cause a considerable loss to growers when the birds are marketed,
since a severely crooked or very deeply dented breastbone
causes the carcass to be graded as no. 2.</p>

<p>It is generally believed that faulty nutrition causes most of the
deformed breastbones, although level roosts narrower than 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>
inches have been known to cause deformities of this kind. If turkeys
are supplied with green feed, fed liberally on one of the rations
suggested, provided with tilted 2 by 4 roosts or medium-sized
poles (see <a href="#Page_35">page 35</a>), and have plenty of direct sunlight, there will
be few crooked breastbones among them. A small number (from 1
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">« 30 »</a></span>
to 2 percent) is to be expected as it seems to be impossible to eliminate
them entirely. The addition to the ration of steamed bone
meal and limestone grit or oyster shell as a mineral reinforcement
is recommended by some poultrymen. However, the various rations,
as listed, supply adequate quantities of the bone-building ingredients.
Further additions are unnecessary and may even be harmful.</p>

<p>During the first 3 or 4 weeks after the poults hatch, two-piece
crockery fountains are excellent milk containers. For water, galvanized
metal containers are more convenient.
When the poults are from 4 to 10
weeks old, water pails, metal troughs, or
shallow tin or graniteware pans provided
with wire or wooden guards are more satisfactory
than fountains. A good method is
to place the water or milk outside the wall
of the brooder room so that the poults can
drink it through a wire screen. From the
age of 9 weeks until market age, a supply
of running water is preferable, although
ordinary water pails set inside the range
house on the wire floor or nails or tubs set
outside the fence, with openings in the wire
for the birds' heads, are satisfactory.
Changing the position of the watering devices
every few days or setting them on
wire-covered platforms will aid in providing
sanitary conditions near the watering
places where filth is likely to accumulate
rapidly. A watertight barrel provided
with a drip faucet and a trough also makes a good watering device.
Shade should be provided to prevent the drinking water from getting
hot. Suitable equipment for feeding mash and scratch feed
is shown in <a href="#Figure_12">figure 12</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>Small trough feeders made of lath (<a href="#Figure_12">fig. 12, <i>A</i></a>) may be used from
the first day in the brooder and until the poults are a week old.
Such feeders are made with 1 lath for the bottom, 2 for the sides,
small sections for end pieces, and another lath for a guard to keep
poults out of the trough. For poults from 8 days to 4 weeks old
it is better to use large trough feeders made of <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>- by 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>-inch
boards for the sides with a top guard consisting of a free-turning
reel. Baling wire stretched inside the troughs (<a href="#Figure_12">fig. 12, <i>C</i></a>) aid in
preventing waste of feed and also serve as beak cleaners for the
birds. To prevent waste, it is better not to fill most trough feeders
more than two-thirds full. In the brooder house it is important to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">« 32 »</a></span>
place feeders on a wire platform made of 1-inch mesh, 16-gage wire,
and 1- by 4- or 1- by 6-inch boards. Poults 5 to 12 weeks old should
have trough feeders made of <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>- by 5-inch boards for the sides,
with a free-turning reel at the top. For poults from 12 weeks old
to market age the feeders should be even larger, as illustrated in

<p>After the age of about 12 weeks, and when feeding is done under
shelter, use a flat-bottomed trough from 12 to 18 feet long or several
short feeders made with a 1- by 10-inch board as a bottom,
1- by 8-inch boards as sides, and with a guard of 1- by 4-inch center
piece topped with a free-turning roller or reel (<a href="#Figure_14">fig. 14</a>). For outside
feeding a similar trough is advisable. It should be divided into two
sections each 6 to 9 feet long, set on 2- by 8- or 2- by 10-inch skids
covered with 1-inch hexagonal mesh, 16-gage wire or heavy gage
1-inch-mesh hardware cloth, and provided with a gable roof and
side boards to protect the feed and the birds from sun, wind, and
rain (<a href="#Figure_15">fig. 15</a>). The troughs can be removed to be used as inside
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">« 33 »</a></span>
feeders and for replenishing the feed. Two 9-foot feeders are sufficient
for 150 to 175 birds. Inside feeding is preferred whenever
possible to provide it.</p>

<h3><a id="HOUSES_AND_FENCES"></a>HOUSES AND FENCES</h3>

<p>A verminproof, weatherproof roosting shelter for growing poults
is an important piece of equipment. A square or rectangular structure
with a shed or gable roof makes a satisfactory range house. A
shed roof is more easily constructed. The use of wire guards called
"antiflies" will keep turkeys off the roof. Allowing for a 5-foot
wire-floored alleyway to hold the feeders and waterers, a house
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">« 34 »</a></span>
about 10 feet wide and 25 feet long (figs. <a href="#Figure_16">16</a>, <a href="#Figure_17">17</a>, <a href="#Figure_18">18</a>, and <a href="#Figure_19">19</a>)
will accommodate 150 to 175 growing turkeys to market age; a
similar house about 16 by 18 feet is large enough for 100 birds.
Feeding and watering can be done inside. For a permanent house,
a height of 5 or 5<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> feet at the caves and about 8 feet at the front
(or the peak, if gable-roofed) is sufficient. If no alleyway is used,
a house 9 by 26 feet containing roosts only should care for 130 to
150 turkeys to market age (figs. <a href="#Figure_20">20</a> and <a href="#Figure_21">21</a>).</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 420px;"><a id="Figure_21"></a>

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 21.</span>&mdash;End elevation of range shelter for turkeys. This type is built without
an alleyway and measures 9 by 20 feet.</div>
</div>

<p>With the latter type of house, feeding and watering must be done
outside, preferably with a covered feeder, as shown in <a href="#Figure_15">figure 15</a>. A
cheaper portable coop, not so high and with framework of lighter
material, is shown in <a href="#Figure_22">figure 22</a>. This coop is built on 4- by 10-inch
skids and is equipped with raised wire floor and with roosts.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 402px;"><a id="Figure_22"></a>
<img src="images/fig22.png" width="402" height="190" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 22.</span>&mdash;Portable turkey range houses equipped with wire floors and antiflies.
The house on the left is 16 by 20 feet and has a feed storage room at one end.</div>
</div>

<p>A permanent house should face south or in a southerly direction
so that the front is not exposed to storms. Board sides on the north
and west are desirable. Practically open-air conditions, combined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">« 35 »</a></span>
with good protection, may be obtained by leaving wire-covered openings
about 2 or 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> feet wide across the north, west, and east sides
at about the level of the roosts. These Openings should be made
closable by shiplap doors that may be partly opened in warm weather
and closed during cold weather and storms. The south side may be
left entirely open except for 1-inch hexagonal mesh of 16- or 18-gage
wire and enough boards to give strength to the building and protect
the birds from rainstorms.</p>

<p>As mentioned on <a href="#Page_29">page 29</a>, desirable roosts may be made of 2 by 4's
with edges beveled and laid flatwise but slightly titled up at about
the angle of a quarter-pitch roof in the direction toward which the
birds are likely to face. Roosts made of 2 by 4's or other sawed lumber
may cause dents in the breastbones if they are laid perfectly flat.
Smooth poles 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> to 5 inches in diameter also make good roosts. Material
less than 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inches wide is not recommended for turkeys half
grown or older. Roosts should be placed preferably 20 to 24 inches
apart (center to center), about 14 inches from the wall and lengthwise
or the building. Those nearest the back wall of the shelter
should be the highest, and each of the others should be about 6
inches lower than the one back of it. This arrangement insures an
even distribution of the birds on the roosts without crowding. Allow
about 1 foot of roost space per bird as they require as much space
as this when approaching market age.</p>

<p>The space beneath the roosts should be fenced off and covered
with 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>-inch, 18-gage wire mesh to prevent the birds from getting
at the droppings. This wire should be placed either on the under
side of the roost supports (<a href="#Figure_17">fig. 17</a>) or on special wire supports (<a href="#Figure_21">fig. 21</a>),
and it should be 6 to 12 inches below the top of the roosts.
When a wire-floored alleyway is used, removable vertical panels
made of 1- by 4-inch boards covered with the 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>-inch hexagonal,
18-gage wire mesh should be placed directly under the roosts which
border the alleyways in such a way as to close the opening underneath
the roosts (<a href="#Figure_19">fig. 19</a>).</p>

<p>In very dry regions, it the space underneath the roosts and wire
floors is entirely enclosed, the droppings may be allowed to accumulate
throughout the entire growing season to save labor. In damp
climates, however, the droppings should be removed frequently.</p>

<p>Wire floors may be used, as described, in the alleyways of roosting
shelters to provide a place for inside feeding and watering and may
also be used in the outside yards when close-confinement rearing is
practiced. A practical method of construction is to make the floor
in removable sections, each about 5 feet square. The framework
should be made of 2 by 4's placed on edge, with the top edge beveled
to present about three-fourths inch of surface; the center supports
may be of 1 by 4's, also placed on edge, spaced 12 to 16 inches apart,
and laid lengthwise of the alleyway (<a href="#Figure_19">fig. 19</a>). This frame should
be covered with 1-inch hexagonal, 16-gage wire mesh or chain-link
fabric wire. Hardware cloth in a 1-inch mesh made of 14-gage wire
is perhaps more satisfactory and will last longer, but the first cost
would be greater. The wire may be fastened with eight-penny nails
and 1-inch staples alternated, one for each strand of wire, but
fastened only to the top or sides of the 2- by 4-inch framework, not
to the center supports. The sections should be set loosely in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">« 36 »</a></span>
alleyway and held 1 inch apart by nails driven into the sides of
the framework. Supports made of either 2 by 4 or 2 by 6 inch
material should be placed on both sides of the alleyway, directly
under the outer framework of the floor panels, and blocked up so
as to hold the floor frames 1 foot above the ground.</p>

<p>Since hen turkeys fly well, it is sometimes difficult to keep them in
their runways. Clipping the large outer feathers (called primaries)
of one wing will do much to prevent the turkeys from flying, but it
is usually necessary to put a 3- or 4-foot guard made of 1 by 4 or 2
by 2 inch material and lightweight poultry wire around the edge of
the roof of the roosting shelters, on gates, and on the fences themselves
for 2 or 3 rods out from the buildings. Whenever practicable,
these "antiflies" should be slanted in toward the yard (figs. <a href="#Figure_16">16</a> and
<a href="#Figure_20">20</a>). Clipping the wings of the toms is undesirable and is usually
unnecessary when antiflies are properly constructed.</p>

<p>A 5-foot fence is usually high enough to confine turkeys, except
near buildings and over gates, where the fence should be 8 or 9 feet
high. Even a 4-foot fence has been reported as satisfactory by some
growers. Steel posts and square-mesh poultry fencing of full standard
weight make good turkey fences.</p>


<h3><a id="PROTECTION_AGAINST_DOGS"></a>PROTECTION AGAINST DOGS</h3>

<p>Dogs cause heavy losses among turkeys in many localities. Turkey
houses must be well constructed to exclude dogs. Wire of 16-gage to
18-gage weight is necessary, and it must be very tightly nailed. The
16-gage weight should be used for the outside of buildings where it
comes close to the ground. Confining the turkeys to their shelters
all night and through the early morning hours is frequently a necessary
precaution unless an attendant is present or protection is afforded
by a good watchdog. Fences for confining poultry are not
always entirely dog-proof. High roosts, provided by some growers,
give protection at night, but in the early morning hours when the
turkeys are off the roosts, an attendant should be in the vicinity.
Feeding the flock inside the shelter is advantageous when turkeys
must be confined during the early morning hours as this greatly
increases the feeding period.</p>


<h3><a id="DEVICES"></a>DEVICES THAT PREVENT TAIL-FEATHER PICKING</h3>

<p>Tail-feather picking seems to begin by the birds' using each others'
tail feathers to clean their beaks of mash. Although it does not ordinarily
damage the birds for market, the habit ruins their appearance
and decreases their salability as breeding stock. It is not always
possible to prevent tail-feather picking entirely, especially in flocks
raised in confinement or in small range lots, but it may be prevented
partially by providing tightly stretched wire in or over the mash
feeders. Baling wire stretched tightly or strips of ordinary light-weight
poultry wire may be used.</p>

<p>Feeding the mash moist will also aid in preventing tail-feather
picking. The kind of mash may also be a factor. A rather coarse
mash containing considerable ground corn, some bran, and some
coarsely ground oats or barley, including the hulls, seems to be more
palatable than a fine mash and is not so likely to clog the beaks of
the birds.</p>

<h2><a name="RANGE_MANAGEMENT_OF_GROWING_TURKEYS" id="RANGE_MANAGEMENT_OF_GROWING_TURKEYS">RANGE MANAGEMENT OF GROWING TURKEYS</a></h2>


<p>In Minnesota a successful system of moving poults around the
colony brooder house has been devised and is giving excellent results.
The house is built with a small opening in each side, and a portable
frame is so placed that the ground on each side of the house can be
used as a small outside run. The birds are allowed to range to the
south for from 5 to 10 days; then the house is thoroughly cleaned and
the range changed to the west; and so on until the land on all four
sides of the house has been utilized. The house is then moved to a
clean spot, and the rotation is repeated. After the birds are from 8
to 12 weeks old the house is again moved to a clean place. Turkeys
may be raised successfully on a small acreage if they are moved to a
clean area each week or two and to an entirely different, clean area
each year.</p>

<p>Other systems of yarding have been devised, but the value of most
of them has not been proved experimentally. Some system of rotation
is necessary on a farm where turkeys are raised regularly. For
fenced ranges where the semiconfinement method is to be used, the
Minnesota plan is entirely satisfactory for small flocks. For large
flocks the use of large yards in the double or triple yarding system has
given good results. Under this system, after 8 or 10 weeks of brooding,
the poults are put on range, which may be divided into 2 or 3
equal parts. The range used is changed yearly or biennially either
by moving the equipment or by having permanent equipment for
each range. In the absence of fences, turkeys may be herded so that
they are protected from enemies and kept within the clean area
allotted to them each season. The use of portable fences and portable
roosting shelters enables the grower to move the entire flock to clean
range each season or several times each season. This method is practical
where large areas of suitable range are available, so that the
birds can be reared each season on land that has not been used, or on
which no droppings have been spread, for the preceding 2 years. In
wet climates it is probably safer to allow a rest of 3 or 4 years.
Enough range should be provided so that plenty of growing green
feed is available in each yard at all times during the season. When
the same ground is used for a whole season, and rainfall or irrigation
is adequate, an acre of grass pasture should provide range and green
feed for about 100 growing turkeys. An acre of alfalfa or clover
would probably provide feed for 150 birds, under favorable conditions.</p>

<p>In arid or semiarid sections, during very dry seasons, it may be
advisable to provide fresh, green feed, or legume hay in abundance
to discourage the turkeys from eating undesirable green feed on the
range. A complete ration must be provided for such conditions.</p>

<p>Where the range is limited to small areas of fenced land, the use
of a number of permanent range houses set in a row, preferably 200
feet or more apart, in the middle of the range and along the dividing
fence is a practical method of range utilization. The dividing fence
should be double so as to provide a neutral area between the two
ranges. Under this plan the birds can use one-half of the range for
2 years in succession and the other half for 2 years without the
buildings being moved. If individual range lots are desired for
each flock of birds, permanent range shelters arranged on either side
of a service lane, each with double or triple yards, are a solution to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">« 38 »</a></span>
the clean-range problem. If double yards are used for each house
or if the range as a whole is divided into 2 sections, a rotation of
2 seasons of use, followed by 2 seasons of rest may be the best plan.
Where 3 yards for each house can be arranged or where the whole
range is divided into 3 large yards, each yard can be used for 1
season and allowed 2 seasons of rest.</p>

<p>Under any system of permanent yards, certain sanitary precautions
are essential. Among these are the following: (1) Select such
a location or modify the one available in such a way that there is as
little drainage as possible from the yards that are being used to
those that are being rested; (2) each season, or several times each
season, remove the accumulations of droppings from the ground
around the houses, feeders, and water vessels; (3) grade up around
each house with fresh earth each season or whenever it is necessary,
to prevent water from standing near the buildings; (4) fill in or
drain all depressions so that water does not stand for any length
of time anywhere on the range; (5) use antiflies and, if necessary,
clip one wing of each bird to keep it from flying into and contaminating
the yards that are being rested; (6) prevent birds or persons
from going in and out of yards that are being rested; (7) move
feeders and water vessels frequently, feed and water the birds inside
the range shelters on the wire floors, or place the feeders and water
vessels outside on roofed wire platforms so that the droppings that
accumulate near them will not become sources of infection; (8) use
contamination-proof feeders and water vessels; (9) see that flies
do not breed extensively in or near the houses and feeders; (10)
place wide boards set into the ground, an inch or two at the bottom
of the fences and extending for about 10 yards out from the buildings
to prevent refuse spreading to the adjoining yards.</p>

<p>When birds are herded on free range some growers move the roosts,
feeders, and water vessels to clean ground several times each season,
whereas others use permanent roosting and feeding quarters and
bring the birds back each night. In either case excessive contamination
at any one point should be prevented so far as possible.</p>

<h2><a name="FATTENING_TURKEYS_FOR_MARKET" id="FATTENING_TURKEYS_FOR_MARKET">FATTENING TURKEYS FOR MARKET</a></h2>


<p>In general, the best method of raising turkeys is to keep them
growing at a normal rate so that at the age of about 6 months they are
in prime market condition, no special fattening period being necessary.
Such a method calls for liberal feeding of balanced rations
throughout the growing period. A good range will supply a large
quantity of feed at a very reasonable cost, but not even the best
range will furnish enough of the right kinds of feed to produce large
numbers of prime turkeys without supplementary feeding.</p>

<p>In many instances, however, turkey growers believe that it is
more profitable to force the birds to forage for most of their livelihood
until a few weeks before marketing time. A good plan for
fattening these range-grown birds is to begin early in the fall to feed
the birds mash and scratch, allowing them all they will eat of both.
As they approach maturity they will eat mostly scratch grain. The
mash may be fed moist or dry. Milk is an excellent fattening feed,
and if plenty of liquid milk is available it may be fed with scratch
grain only and no mash. Some turkey raisers feed equal parts of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">« 39 »</a></span>
corn, wheat, and oats during the first part of the fattening season
and gradually change to all corn as the weather becomes cooler. This
system is satisfactory if plenty of milk can be fed in addition. Without
milk or some other high-protein feed, the results are likely to be
unsatisfactory. If too heavy feeding of corn alone is begun before
the range turkeys become accustomed to it, the disease known as
scours often results, especially if new corn is used. Old corn is a
much better feed than new corn, but the new crop is safe after it is
well matured and dry.</p>

<p>As a general rule, turkeys that have been raised on free range
cannot be successfully fattened in close confinement. They may be
successfully fattened, however, if they are confined to moderate-sized
yards containing growing alfalfa or other green crops or stacks
of alfalfa or clover hay. There is no advantage in confining turkeys
which have been raised in semiconfinement to smaller quarters for
fattening.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="MARKETING_TURKEYS" id="MARKETING_TURKEYS">MARKETING TURKEYS</a></h2>


<p>The marketing season for the bulk of the turkey crop is usually
comparatively short, extending from the middle of November to the
latter part of December. There is an increasing demand in the fall
and winter and even in late summer for young turkeys. Many turkey
raisers sell their birds alive to poultry dealers, who either dress
them or ship them alive to city dealers. In sections where turkeys
are grown in large numbers, as in Texas, dressing plants have been
built by cooperative associations and poultry dealers who collect the
live birds and dress them for the various city markets. As soon as
possible after reaching the dressing plant, the turkeys are killed,
dry-picked, cooled, and packed in barrels or boxes for shipment.</p>

<p>Farmers near the city markets often dress their turkeys and sell
them direct either to the consumer or to the city dealer. In territory
adjacent to large cities marketing both live and dressed birds at
roadside stands has become common.</p>


<h3><a id="WHEN_TO_MARKET"></a>WHEN TO MARKET</h3>

<p>Experiments with Bronze turkeys have indicated that well-fed,
young birds of this popular variety are marketed to best advantage
at from 24 to 28 weeks of age, if they are in good flesh and reasonably
free from short pinfeathers. If they are kept longer than 28 weeks,
the cost of maintenance and gains and the extra labor of their care
cause the costs of production to rise rapidly. Under ordinary conditions
26 to 28 weeks is the best age for marketing full-fed Bronze
turkey toms. For turkeys fed for rapid growth 24 weeks is a more
profitable age if the birds are ready for market then, as is often the
case with young hens which mature more quickly than the toms.
Data obtained on more than 600 birds at the United States Range
Livestock Experiment Station at Miles City, Mont., show that at
24 weeks of age the feed cost of producing live turkeys was 1 cent
per pound lower than at 26 weeks of age, and 2.5 cents per pound
lower than at 28 weeks. These figures, of course, will vary in
different years, depending on the price of feeds. Besides this cost for
feed the extra labor in caring for the birds, often during unfavorable
weather, must be considered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">« 40 »</a></span></p>

<p>With the expansion of the turkey industry, the chain stores have
become one of the large wholesale buyers of turkeys. They desire
various sizes, according to the nature of the patronage in different
localities, and as a result create a considerable market demand for
hens and small toms. This is particularly true of their Thanksgiving
and Christmas trade. Other channels of trade, such as restaurants,
hotels, steamships, and railroad lines, prefer large toms. As turkeys
become more generally used throughout the year an increase in the
trade for small birds may be expected.</p>


<h3><a id="SELECTING_BIRDS"></a>SELECTING BIRDS FOR MARKET</h3>

<p>Practically all turkeys that are full fed are ready for market at
from 26 to 28 weeks of age, and in many cases at 24 weeks, depending
on sex, breeding, feeding, and weather. However, with range birds
on limited feed, the grower can probably afford to hold his turkeys
longer than 26 or 28 weeks, if necessary, because the feed costs were
low during the growing period. It is, of course, very important to
market only turkeys that are fat and free from small pinfeathers.
Sufficient protein and minerals in the feed during the fall months are
essential to proper growth and economical gains as well as to proper
feather development. A prime turkey, especially a young one, is
not expected to be excessively fat, but it must have an even covering
of fat so that the skin appears white or yellowish white rather than
dark or bluish. The breast must be meaty and the whole body free
from small pinfeathers, bruises, and abrasions. Great care should
be taken, therefore, not to allow the birds to bruise themselves by
flying or running against obstructions; they should be handled
gently and not frightened.</p>


<h3><a id="WITHHOLDING_FEED"></a>WITHHOLDING FEED BEFORE SLAUGHTER</h3>

<p>Birds with feed in their crops are usually graded as no. 2 and sold
at a lower price because feed in the crop spoils readily, and also detracts
from the appearance of the carcass. Mash feed passes out of
the crop quickly so that crops will be empty if the mash is removed
at dusk on the day before slaughter and no scratch grain fed on that
day. If the birds are kept without feed for more than 18 or 24 hours
they may eat soil, litter, droppings, or feathers, and thus defeat the
main purpose of withholding feed. This applies especially to old
hens. If the birds are not to be killed until late afternoon or evening,
give them a light feed of mash early in the morning. Scratch grain
should be fed only until about 18 hours before slaughter. Feeding
should always be planned so that feed is not withheld more than 24
hours. All birds being held for slaughter should have free access
to water up to killing time.</p>


<h3><a id="KILLING_AND_PICKING"></a>KILLING AND PICKING</h3>

<p>When the bird is to be killed, hang it up by the feet, holding its
head in one hand and taking care not to compress the veins in the
neck. Open the mouth and cut the jugular vein far back in the
throat, just below the base of the skull. For this purpose use the
point of a sharp, narrow-bladed knife. As soon as profuse bleeding
begins, thrust the knife up through the groove in the roof of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">« 41 »</a></span>
mouth and into the rear lobe of the brain at the back of the skull
so as to render the bird unconscious. When the correct "stick" is
obtained, the bird usually gives a peculiar squawk, the tail feathers
spread, and all the feathers are loosened by a quivering of the
muscles. After sticking, continue to hold the bird's head and attach
a blood cup to the lower jaw. The bird's wings should never be
locked, as this often results in their being broken, which usually
reduces the bird to a low grade. Likewise, no attempt should be
made to hold the bird's wings tightly. Blood cups weighing 5
pounds are needed for large birds, whereas cups weighing 3 to 4
pounds are best for small and medium-sized birds.</p>

<p>In dry picking it is essential that the feathers be plucked immediately
after the bird is killed. If the bird has been properly stuck,
they come out very easily. First remove the tail and large wing
feathers and then the body feathers, leaving the small wing feathers
and neck and upper breast feathers until last. Pull out all feathers
a few at a time, but do not rub them off as this injures the skin and
often lowers the grade. Dry picking can be learned best by personal
instructions. The semiscald method of picking turkeys is used in
some sections at commercial dressing plants, but nearly all home-dressed
turkeys are dry-picked.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Detailed information on killing, grading, and marketing turkeys is given in Farmers'
Bulletins 1694. Dressing and Packing Turkeys, and 1815, Grading Dressed Turkeys.</p></div>

<p>Clean-picked turkeys are now preferred, but a single row of short
fan feathers on the last joint of each wing may be left. Leave no
feathers on any other part of the body. Remove all pinfeathers, especially
from the breast, but do not attempt to dig out pinfeathers
too short to be pulled. After picking, snap the blood from the
bird's mouth with a quick motion and squeeze the vent to remove
any droppings that may be there. The feet, if dirty, should be
washed and dried. These methods make for clean carcasses, good
grades, and good keeping quality. After picking and chilling the
birds, cover the heads with head wraps made of heavy waxed paper,
to prevent blood soaking through and smearing the carcasses.
Whenever the skin is torn, sew it neatly with white thread.</p>

<p>When birds have been killed with feed in their crops, remove the
entire crop. Through a 2- or 3-inch slit in the neck, beginning
where the neck joins the body, the crop can be completely loosened
and withdrawn, the gullet being cut well below the crop. Then sew
the opening with No. 36 white thread. Turn in the edges of the skin
so as to make a neat job that will not be noticeable when the bird
is put on the market.</p>

<p>According to data on Bronze turkeys, killing and picking after
the birds had been starved overnight resulted in a loss of about 9
percent of weight for large birds and 10 percent for small birds.
The turkeys were weighed both before and after they were killed
and picked and again after they had cooled overnight. The larger
birds had the lower percentages of loss in weight and therefore the
higher dressing percentages. The weight loss of dressed turkeys
while chilling overnight is very small, only about one-sixth of 1
percent. Therefore, practically all the loss in weight that occurs
during picking and chilling results from the loss of blood and
feathers. The weight loss of turkeys overnight just before slaughter
when they received no feed was about 3 percent, on an average,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">« 42 »</a></span>
making the total loss from their normal weight, due to withholding
feed, picking, and chilling, about 13 percent. When dressed turkeys
are drawn, with head and feet removed and giblets replaced, there
is a further loss of about 15 percent of the dressed weight.</p>

<h3><a name="COOLING" id="COOLING">COOLING</a></h3>

<p>Hanging the birds indoors by the legs for 24 hours or more, or
laying them on their backs on a clean surface where the temperature
of the air ranges from 30° to 36° F. will properly chill the carcasses.
They should be thoroughly chilled but not frozen, since frozen birds
sweat and, because of their rigid condition, cannot be packed without
great waste of space. In mild weather it is often impossible to cool
the carcasses properly without the use of refrigeration or ice water.
Cooling in water spoils the appearance of dry-picked carcasses and
should be done only as a last resort. A suitable thermometer is an
indispensable part of the chilling equipment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">« 43 »</a></span></p>


<h3><a id="PACKING"></a>PACKING</h3>

<p>Boxes and barrels are generally used for packing dressed turkeys.
Packing in clean barrels, while easier and slightly cheaper, is not so
satisfactory as box packing, although barrels are often more readily
available.</p>

<p>Boxes are greatly preferred by the trade and by organized pools.
In box packing, the single-layer pack of 6 to 14 birds, depending on
their size, is preferred. The boxes are usually large enough to hold
from 10 to 12 medium-sized birds (<a href="#Figure_23">fig. 23</a>).</p>

<p>When barrels are used, a large size is necessary for large toms.
Smaller barrels are suitable for hens and small toms. Line the
barrel with white wrapping paper or common white parchment
paper. Lay the birds with their backs against the sides of the barrel,
and if it is necessary to pack larger birds in the same barrel,
place them in the center. When the barrel is full, turn down the
paper, take off the top hoop, place a piece of clean burlap over the
top, and replace and renail the hoop over the burlap.</p>

<p>Boxes, barrels, or any other containers used should be free from
objectionable odor, as the turkey meat may absorb it.</p>

<p>There is considerable risk for the producer who does not have
access to proper refrigerating facilities in shipping dressed turkeys
during mild weather. If the birds are to be sold in mild weather, it
is safest to market them alive or else sell them dressed to local purchasers
as losses from improper cooling of dressed turkeys and from
exposure to warm weather during transit are likely to occur. When
turkeys are to be shipped only a short distance it may be feasible to
chill the dressed birds in ice water and then to pack them in barrels
with cracked ice between layers and at each end of the barrel. A
top layer of ice placed between two layers of burlap tacked securely
over the top of the barrel is desirable. The internal temperature of
the turkeys should be reduced to 34° F. before they are shipped.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="DRESSED-TURKEY_GRADES" id="DRESSED-TURKEY_GRADES">DRESSED-TURKEY GRADES</a></h2>


<p>Grading systems for dressed turkeys differ somewhat in different
markets but, in general, are similar. Greatest uniformity is provided
where the United States grades are used. The United States
grading system is more comprehensive than other systems and is
intended to satisfy the demands of the consumers more fully and
to promote more uniform grading.</p>

<p>The United States Government grading system was developed
and is sponsored by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, United
States Department of Agriculture. Under this system as now used
there are four grades: U. S. Special or U. S. grade AA; U. S. Prime
or U. S. grade A; U. S. Choice or U. S. grade B; and U. S. Commercial
or U. S. grade C. Each grade is subdivided into four classes
according to the age and sex of the birds.</p>

<p>These classes are: Young hen, young tom, old hen, and old tom.
The quality specifications for individual birds apply to each class
with due allowance for fleshing condition characteristic of its sex
and age. Detailed descriptions are provided for each grade. For
the U. S. Special grade it is required that turkeys have broad, full-fleshed
breasts and that the carcasses be fully covered with fat. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">« 44 »</a></span>
birds must also have been well bled, carefully dry-picked or semiscalded,
and must be free from bruises, skin tears, and broken
joints. The breastbone must be straight or only slightly dented
(not more than one-fourth inch in depth). For the U. 3. Prime
grade it is required that birds be well fleshed, well fattened, and
well bled, but they may have slight imperfections such as scattered
pinfeathers, slight flesh or skin abrasions, and one disjointed but
not broken wing or leg. Slightly curved and slightly dented breastbones,
not to exceed one-half inch in depth, are permitted. To grade
U. S. Choice, turkeys must have fairly well-fleshed breasts and carcasses
fairly well covered with fat. These birds need be only fairly
well bled and dressed and may have slight flesh or skin bruises, small
skin tears, or larger sewn-up tears, and one broken leg or wing.
Turkeys not meeting these grade requirements, including birds
poorly fleshed, poorly bled, or slightly deformed, but suitable for
food, make up the lowest or U. S. Commercial grade.</p>

<p>Another system of grading in common use in buying dressed
turkeys is to make only 2 or 3 grades, except that sometimes the
birds within the top grades are divided into classes based on weight
and sex. The no. 1 grade usually consists of young toms weighing
12 pounds or more and young and old hens weighing 8 pounds or
more, dressed. For this grade the birds must be well finished and
free from serious tears, bruises, and severely crooked breastbones.
The crops must be empty and the carcasses reasonably free from
pinfeathers and reasonably well bled. The no. 2 grade includes
all old toms and such young toms, young hens, and old hens as are
too light for the no. 1 grade. The no. 2 grade also includes turkeys
with severely crooked breastbones, broken wings, bad blemishes, bad
tears, bad abrasions, feed in crops, numerous pinfeathers, and birds
that have been poorly bled or poorly fleshed. The no. 3 grade
includes birds not good enough for the no. 2 grade but still fit for
food. These are culls that never should have been marketed. The
no. 3 grade is not always used, since turkeys of this kind are often
rejected by the buyers. On some markets a medium grade of birds&mdash;between
the no. 1 and the no. 2 grades&mdash;is used.</p>

<p>When graded and packed for market turkeys are further graded
as to size, birds of similar weight being placed in the same container,
which is labeled according to the grade.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
